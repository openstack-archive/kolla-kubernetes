Since Docker is required to build images as well as be present on all deployed
targets, the kolla-kubernetes community recommends installing the official
Docker, Inc. packaged version of Docker for maximum stability and compatibility.

.. NOTE:: Docker 1.11.0 is not compatible with Kubernetes do to some issues in
Docker. The below command will install the lasted docker and revert back to
1.10.3.

::

    curl -sSL https://get.docker.io | bash

    # CentOS
    sudo yum downgrade -y docker-engine-1.10.3-1.el7.centos

    # Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get remove docker-engine
    sudo apt-get install docker-engine=1.10.3-1

Docker needs to run with MountFlags=shared in order for Neutron to function
in 'thin' containers.  Change MountFlags from slave to shared and restart
Docker.

::
   # Edit /usr/lib/system/systemd/docker.service
   MountFlags=shared

   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl start docker

HyperCube
=========

HyperKube is series of containers that will run all the needed Kubernetes
services locally.

If you prefer to run Kubernetes in containers follow the :doc:`kubernetes-all
-in-one`.
