=============================
Memcached in Kolla-Kubernetes
=============================

Overview
========

`Memcached <https://memcached.org/>_ is the default persistant cache for a
`Kolla-Kubernetes cluster.

Preparation and Deployment
==========================

Memcached is self-sufficent, thus it's one of the first things you want to
start while installing.

Memcache does not require bootstrapping.  To create the Replication Controller
that will keep Memcached running::

    kolla-kubernetes start memcached

Verify Operation
================

To find the IP address of the kubernetes service so you can test for
functionality on a machine inside of the Kubernetes cluster (e.g. running
Kube-proxy) but not running as a container::

    kubectl get svc memcached

Once you know the IP address and port, you can check to see if memcached is
responding to requests by replacing <ADDRESS> with the address of the
memcached service::

    echo "stats settings" | nc <ADDRESS> 11211

You should see output looking like this:::

    STAT maxbytes 67108864
    STAT maxconns 1024
    STAT tcpport 11211
    STAT udpport 11211
    STAT inter 0.0.0.0

    STAT oldest 0
    STAT evictions on
