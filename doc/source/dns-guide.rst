============================
DNS in Kolla-Kubernetes
============================

Overview
========

DNS service provides the ability to dynamically discover services
in Kubernetes cluster. DNS is required for kolla-kubernetes services
to auto-wire and locate each other. Hosted k8s providers (GKE) and
Turnkey k8s providers (aws) are usually create with DNS support
enabled by default.  If your custom kubernetes cluster has not been
setup to support DNS, then these instructions will help you setup
the SkyDNS add-on.

Preparation and Deployment
============================

Even though DNS service is a mandatory component of Kolla Kubernetes,
the operators are not forced to use Kolla Kubernetes DNS service
deployment tools. If the operator has already deployed and working DNS
infrastructure, Kolla Kubernetes will use it. The operator just need to
inform Kolla Kubernetes about the used domain name  by configuring
dns_domain_name variable.

DNS service when deployed by Kolla Kubernetes tools requires two mandatory
parameters configured in etc/kolla-kubernetes/kolla-kubernetes.yml file.

::

    dns_server_ip: "X.X.X.X"
    dns_domain_name: "{domain_name}"


For dns_server_ip, the operator needs to choose an unused ip address
from the IP range allocated to Kubernetes service. This IP address
must be reachable from all PODs running on the kubernetes cluster.

::
 
    #Example:
    dns_server_ip: "10.57.0.2"


For dns_domain_name, the operator can specify any domain name which
are compliant with the existing DNS naming convention (RFC 1035).
This domain name will be automatically appended to all kubernetes
objects created for Kolla OpenStack.

::

    #Example:
    dns_domain_name: "openstack.local"


Kolla Kubernetes offers two ways to deploy DNS:

  - As a part of Ansible workflow of deploying Kolla Kubernetes.

  - Manual, by using kolla-kubernetes cli tool.


Manual deployment includes two steps:

::

    # 1. Creation of DNS service using:

    kolla-kubernetes resource create svc skydns

    # 2. Creation of DNS Replication Controller using:

    kolla-kubernetes resource create pod skydns


Kubernetes cluster modification
===============================
Kubernetes cluster must be made aware of the existence of DNS service. It
has done by adding two parameters to kubelet service startup command.

::

    --cluster-dns="":    Same IP address for a cluster DNS server as in
                     kolla-kubernetes.yml
    --cluster-domain="": Same Domain name as specified in kolla-kubernetes.yml


Verify Operation
================

In case of Ansible deployment of DNS, Ansible will be responsible to
verify the success of DNS deployment and report it to the operator.
Manual deployment can be verified by running:

::

    kubectl get svc | grep dns
    #dns service should be listed in the output

    kubectl get pod | grep dns
    #dns pod should be listed in the output and it should be in "Running" state.
