Kubernetes Setup Guide
======================

There are many options in existance for setting up Kubernetes. These guides
are meant for developers and operators who want to use the same tools the
community is using to setup Kubernetes.  The guides are based off of existing
tools in the Kubernetes community.

Setting up Kubernetes is **optional** if you have an operational Kubernetes
cluster version of 1.3 or greater.

The community recommends new developers trying out a single node deployment of
kolla-kubernetes to start with.
