==========================
Specfications are Advisory
==========================

This project is under heavy active development.  Specifications in this repository
record "streams of thought" rather than a direct set of actions to take.  As an
example, kolla-ansible looks much different today than then ansible-multi spec.  For
Kolla old-timers, many know that Kolla in its present form may not have existed without
stream of thought recording that occured in that one specification.

All specifications in this repository are subject to abandonment in the future if
the development team finds it necessary to change course.

The single source of truth for development work is recorded in blueprints as specifications
are immutable once committed to the repository.  Blueprints on the other hand are dynamic
and may be changed.
