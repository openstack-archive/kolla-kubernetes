  # - WARNING: These sample defaults configure ceph access using the
  #   ceph "admin" user/key, because it involves the least amount of
  #   work for the a user to get ceph volumes working.  However, it is
  #   highly recommended that the operator create a dedicated ceph
  #   user/key with access only to the ceph pool to be used by this
  #   Kubernetes cluster.
  #
  # Kubernetes nodes act as ceph clients because they must mount ceph
  #   volumes on behalf of pods.  For a particular ceph user, there
  #   are two ways to pass the ceph secret keyring to Kubernetes.
  #
  #   1) The ceph user secret keyring may be loaded as a kubernetes
  #      secret.  The base64-encoded secret must be referenced by
  #      storage_ceph.key.  To disable this method, comment out the
  #      storage_ceph.key definition or set the value to "".  The
  #      encoded secret may be created with this command:
  #      $ ssh ceph-mon cat /etc/ceph/path/to/ceph.client.keyring \
  #          | grep key | awk '{print $3}' | base64
  #
  #   2) The ceph user secret keyring may be stored on the Kubernetes
  #      node's filesystem, and then referenced by
  #      storage_ceph.keyring.  To disable this method, comment out
  #      the storage_ceph.keyring definition or set the value to "".
  #
  # If both configurations are defined, Method 1) above takes
  #   precedence over method 2).  Prefer using Method 1) to avoid
  #   provisioning the ceph key on every node, which is difficult if
  #   using cloud provider auto-provisioning.
