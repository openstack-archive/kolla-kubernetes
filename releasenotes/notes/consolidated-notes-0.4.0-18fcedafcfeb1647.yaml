prelude: >
    This unstable release is highly focused on implementing Helm packaged
    microservices of OpenStack services based upon interaction with the
    Helm upstream community and the kolla-kubernetes-core sub-team of Kolla.
features:
  - Global helm API implementation permitting standardization of the ABI
  - Implemented helm build microservices python code
  - Implemented helm build repo python code
  - Implemented helm build services python code
  - Documented a development environment based upon AT&T's halycon Kubernetes
    deployment project
  - Gating for full Kubernetes/Ceph/iSCSI/OpenStack deployment including
    multinode tests and basic function tests of the deployed system.
  - Configmap generation via genconfig (to be revisited later)
  - Deployment of working compute kit using helm packages
  - External openvswitch support
  - Optional support for kubernetes-entrypoint
  - Prototyped service packages for easier deployment (work in progress)

issues:
  - No upgrade technique is supported.
  - Ceph is dangerous in its current state in Kolla-Kubernetes and only for
    testing purposes.
  - Version 2.0.2 of the Kolla containers (Mitaka) are used in this release.
    We will rectify this deficiency in 0.5.0.
upgrade:
  - There is no way to upgrade, however, a stable helm API has been
    implemented.  This paves the way for upgrades in the future.
other:
  - the kolla-kubernetes deliverable has not actively been using reno
    during development.
    As of this release the Kolla core team is rolling up the release notes
    for 0.4.0 and committed to creating reno notes for all future commits.
