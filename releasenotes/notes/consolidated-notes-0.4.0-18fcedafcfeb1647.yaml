prelude: >
    This unstable release is highly focused on implementing Helm packaged
    microservices of OpenStack services based upon interaction with the
    Helm upstream community and the kolla-kubernetes-core sub-team of Kolla.
features:
  - Global helm API implementation permitting standardization of the ABI
  - Implemented helm build microservices python code
  - Implemented helm build repo python code
  - Implemented helm build services python code
  - Documented a development environment using the Halcyon-Kubernetes
    deployment project
  - Gating for full Kubernetes/Ceph/iSCSI/OpenStack deployment including
    multinode tests and basic function tests of the deployed system
  - Configmap generation via genconfig (to be revisited later)
  - Deployment of working compute kit using helm packages
  - External openvswitch support
  - Optional support for kubernetes-entrypoint
  - Prototyped service packages for easier deployment (work in progress)

issues:
  - No upgrade technique is supported.
  - Ceph Helm packaging is dangerous in its current state in Kolla-Kubernetes
    and only for testing purposes. Using ceph on the other hand within
    Kolla-Kubernetes works well.
  - Version 2.0.2 of the Kolla containers (Mitaka) are used in this release.
    Some small subset of containers use version 3.0.2 as well as one 4.0.0
    container (entrypoint).  The kolla-kubernetes-core team will rectify this
    deficiency in 0.5.0.
upgrade:
  - There is no way to upgrade, however, a stable Helm API has been
    implemented.  This paves the way for upgrades in the future.
other:
  - The kolla-kubernetes deliverable has not actively been using reno
    during development. As of this release the Kolla core team is rolling
    up the release notes for 0.4.0 and committed to creating reno notes for
    future commits where a releasenote would be applicable.
